2. Data preprocessing

In the 


3. Document Embedding Folder

In the Document_Embedding_model_build, it includes several models' code.
# a. Document Embedding Parameter Tuning
# b. Baseline Model -- Document Embedding
# c. Baseline model -- Price feature
# d. MSE plot of baseline models
# e. Build All-feature Predictors
# f. Parameter tuning of regression model

There are two csv files contains the MSE results of e. Build All-feature Predictors  and f.Parameter tuning of regression model


4. TF-IDF Folder 

The TF-IDF folder contains two sub-folder, TF-IDF_Baseline and TF-IDF_all_feature.
# a.TF-IDF_Baseline contains the code for TF-IDF baseline model builder, After-preprocessing data, and stopword list.
# b.TF-IDF_all_feature contains the code for TF-IDF all features model builder, After-preprocessing data, and stopword list.
